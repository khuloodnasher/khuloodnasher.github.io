Define The Problem
Background
As a response to the COVID 19 pandemic and for the sake of supporting the job market of America, President Donald Trump issued a new proclamation on June 22, 2020, to suspend issuing of new visas that is categorized as a non-immigrant visa but it gives the applicants the right to enter to America and the eligibility to work any kind of job, Source of June 22 Proclamation. The June 22 proclamation is an extension to the previous suspension that started on April 22, 2020, that was supposed to last 60 days, Source of April 22 Proclamation. The type of visas affected by this proclamation are the H, L, and some of the J visas.
Main Questions:
1- What do people think about proclamation June 22?
2- What aspects get the most negative mentions?
3- What aspects get the most positive mentions?
To answer those questions, I performed a twitter sentiment analysis. I collected tweets during the period from June 26-July 25 2020.
Sentiments of the public were collected weekly basis by tracing the following hashtags:
# H2bvisa
#h4visa
#Lvisa
#J1 Visa
# h1bvisa
#workvisa
